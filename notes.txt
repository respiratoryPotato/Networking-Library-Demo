what this is:
	this is the project just after I came back to it
why the backup was made:
	I came back to the project. Going to add more efficient data transfers

remember to add:
	connection can have specific callbacks for specific messages
	callbacks can be added at runtime (don't remove options (yet))

in production, allow for a version of the file that contains only the client code
